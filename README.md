The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

# ENCOUNTERED PROBLEMS

At times, after searching for a card and then fetching all cards again, the function loadMoreCards(which is fired when user has scrolled to the bottom) fires more than once, causing it to fetch the incorrect page number.
